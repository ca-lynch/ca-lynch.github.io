				<h2>A little about me...</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My name is Cody Lynch and I am from Houston, Texas. I am 30 years old and have lived most of my life in Texas. Originally, 
				I wanted to go into emergency services. I started volunteering for a local fire department when I was in high school. One night, we had a call for a 
				medical emergency where someone had overdosed. I saw the medics on scene and fell in love with EMS. I then went to Lone Star College and received my 
				EMT certification and worked on an ambulance in Houston. After a while I decided to enlist in the military and served 4 years as an infantryman 
				in the US Army. I was able to travel the world and get experiences that not many people get. I got out of the Army in 2017 and am now working towards 
				my BS in Computer Information Systems.</p>
				<h2>Where to go from here?</h2>
				<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I am currently an unemployed full-time student, so my focus is on school. My short-term goals are to get an internship, 
				maintain my GPA, and to receive my degree. I know my GPA isn’t super important in the real world, but I do pride myself on my grades. I’ve been 
				able to maintain a cumulative GPA of 3.7, and my goal is to graduate with no less than 3.5. My long-term goal is to find a job once I have my BS, and
				then continue on to get my Masters while I work. I’m not certain what exactly I want to do yet, but so far, I’m interested in cybersecurity, programming, 
				and system administration. I want to at least get my master’s degree, and I am considering staying at UH and applying to the cybersecurity Masters program.</p>
